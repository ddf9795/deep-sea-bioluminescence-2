# deep sea bioluminescence 2
 
requires godotsteam 3.5.1

A project for my IGME-531 Aesthetics & Computation class. Our task was to remake and expand upon a previous assignment. I remade my original ["deep sea bioluminescence"](https://editor.p5js.org/ddf9795/full/X9caANiNC) project in 3D space and many more visual effects.
